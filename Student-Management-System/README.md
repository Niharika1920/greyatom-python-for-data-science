### Project Overview

 Basically in this project we can store the student details, pick up the students based on the criteria like who scored the highest in a particular subject, who scored the least etc.


### Learnings from the project

 Simple projects can be made that make our tasks easier with just basics of Python


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I used the basic data types like lists,dictionaries and looping statements like for. Also I have implemented methods like dict.values in it.


### Challenges faced

 Getting to know the built-in methods were a difficuilt task . Going through the python documentation and web sites like geeks for geeks and programmiz helped me in better understanding.
